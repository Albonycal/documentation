# Revolt Documentation

Welcome to the Revolt documentation, everything you need to help contribute, build apps or bots, or learn more about the project.

## How To Help

You can help contribute to Revolt in a variety of ways.

### 1. Feedback

The easiest, but most important way to contribute to Revolt, is to voice your opinion and give feedback.
We are always awaiting your feature suggestions, bug reports and general opinions on everything Revolt has to offer.

From the Revolt app you can navigate to the [**feedback tab**](https://app.revolt.chat/settings/feedback), or open an issue on the relevant [GitLab project](https://gitlab.insrt.uk/revolt).

### 2. Translate

Revolt is used by users all around the world: but it can always be more accessible if the user interface is in the native language of the user.
You can contribute translations through [**Weblate**](https://weblate.insrt.uk/engage/revolt/).

### 3. Donate

Revolt is not backed by a big company and does not serve you advertisements: Revolt relies entirely on donations for all financial backing.
You can donate directly through [**Ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/insertish) or [contact me](https://insrt.uk) for alternative ways to donate.
If you are trying to donate a large sum of money, please consult me first.

### 4. Code

Revolt is an open source project which means you can volunteer to come help build features or fix bugs.
All current issues and tasks are tracked on [**Wekan**](https://wekan.insrt.uk/b/jj3x5C6nbYzM6ERQD/revolt) (you may need to login for it to display correctly) and through [GitLab issues](https://gitlab.insrt.uk/revolt).
If you want to find a relatively easy task, look out for issues marked as **low-hanging fruit**.

:::info

Please let us know when picking up an issue so that multiple people don't conflict and so that we can work out a plan if the issue or feature is quite large.

You can ask on the [**official Revolt server**](https://app.revolt.chat/invite/Testers) or open an issue on GitLab.
