# 3. Scaling & Monetisation

To start answering this question:
- Revolt is already pretty efficient and can scale both vertically and horizontally.
- The problem areas are known and can be easily fixed with a bit of work, so we can improve performance as we go along.
- As proof of this, right now, it costs nothing for the team to run Revolt, literally nothing. (18th August)

Now you may be asking how will Revolt be funded?

- We have a variety of monetisation ideas lined up internally, **none of which involve paywalling features**!
- We currently have [Â£600 in donations](https://cloud.insrt.uk/s/K6QDcgBAwgdFqXb) (as of 18th August) from our community, which hav3n't been spent at all.
- Given everything I've seen so far, it's likely some of the monetisation strategies we thought of are likely to succeed, some will also allow us to support community members who create awesome things.
