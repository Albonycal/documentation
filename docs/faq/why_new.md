# 2. Why another project?

People also often ask why we wouldn't just contribute to a new project, really there's two things I would split that into.

### Learning Experience

Revolt has really taught me **a lot** about different concepts and programming languages, and really, that's how developers learn. We make cool projects to try to better how we work, it doesn't matter if someone has done it before as long as you can attempt to do the same. Reinventing the wheel is part of the process.

### Not Much Competition (not that it matters)

Discord doesn't actually have much of viable competitors in its own specific genre of chat platform, we're just sort of filling the void.

### Why was the project started anyways?

I have no clue.
